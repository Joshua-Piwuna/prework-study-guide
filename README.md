# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As bootcamp students we encounter, and conquer, many challenges along the way. However, time and again, one problem that we face is keeping track of the amount of information they are learning each day. There is so much information for boot camp students that it can be overwhelming at times to keep track of this information.
Webpages are excellent at displaying and storing information in a user-friendly way. To solve our problem, we've built a website that can be used as a study guide.
